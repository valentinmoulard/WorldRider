# Gameplay
The player can control his car by taping on the left side or the right side of the screen.
The goal of the game is to avoid the enemy cars, destroy them by using the barrels inside the level and collecting currency.
The fun of the game resides in making the highest score possible and by tricking the other cars into the traps that the player can set up.

# Environment
The barels can be activated only when the player touches them. After a certain delay, the barel will trigger an explosion damaging any cars in the area of effect.
The lasers can be spawned in the level and rotates. The lasers damage any cars touching them.
Enemy cars will spawn off carema and will drive towards the player.
The spawn rate of enemies, barels and lasers increases over time.

# Sound
I chose a dynamic sound for the game and added sound effects for the barrels activation, barrel explosion, cars collison cars explosion.

I used models from the Unity asset store
