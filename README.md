# Gameplay
The player can control his car by taping on the left side or the right side of the screen.
The goal of the game is to avoid the enemy cars, destroy them by using the barrels inside the level and collecting currency.

# Environment
The barels can be activated only when the player touches them. After a certain delay, the barel will trigger an explosion damaging any cars in the area of effect.
The lasers can be spawned in the level and rotates. The lasers damage any cars touching them.

# Sound
I chose a dynamic sound for the game and added sound effects for the barrels activation, barrel explosion, cars collison cars explosion.

# Sources 
I used models from the Unity asset store
