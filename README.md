# Gameplay
The player can control his car by taping on the left side or the right side of the screen.
The goal of the game is to avoid the enemy cars, destroy them by using the barrels inside the level and collecting currency.

# Sound
I chose a dynamic sound for the game and added sound effects for the barrels activation, barrel explosion, cars collison cars explosion.

# Sources 
I used models from the Unity asset store
